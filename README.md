			# Version Control System, university project

	The application supports a minimal set of unix commands(cd, mkdir, ls, touch, rm, writetofile, cat, print) and a set of vcs commands to save the current state of the file system (vcs status, vcs branch, vcs commit, vcs checkout, vcs log, vcs rollback). Each command will be read from an input file and will generate an output or an error message that will be written to the output file. The vcs commnad are implemented by me.

	The project is implemented in Java.

	Program testing is done automatically by running the checker.sh script.
	The goal of the poo_checks.xml and checkstyle-7.3-all.jar files is to identify places in the code that may be in non-compliance with google style.
